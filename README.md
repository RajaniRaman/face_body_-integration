# Face-body integration in CNNs

## CNN's response to face-body configuration stimuli

We interact with agents and not with arbitrary concatenations of two different parts: a body and a head with a face. Since deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are, currently, the best models of the ventral visual system, here, we explore how they interact with different face-body configurations.
